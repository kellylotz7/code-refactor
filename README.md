# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this challenge I made changes to the code to made it more readable and more concise. This included creating semantic html tags to replace generic div tags as well as consolidating class definitions that were repetitive. I also added alt desciptions for all images. The page looks and operates the exact same, aside from the change in title to make it more specific as well as making it so that clicking the h1 element on the nav bar brings you back to the top of the main page.

Below are screenshots of the landing page:
